# The TAIL Rating Scheme
We spend most of our lives inside buildings. So, the quality of these indoor spaces really affects our health and happiness. As we focus more on public health, it's important to check how good or bad these indoor spaces are. A good indoor space is not just good for our health, but also helps us work better and improves our life.
## The ALDERN Project
The [ALDREN project](https://aldren.eu), led by the CSTB (Centre Scientifique et Technique du Bâtiment), was a European Union project that aimed to improve energy use in buildings across Europe. ALDERN stands for Alliance for Deep Renovation in buildings. The project wanted to provide tools and measures that make sure buildings perform as expected, including being healthy for people to use.
A big part of the ALDREN project was checking the quality of indoor spaces in buildings that have had major energy improvements.
## The TAIL Index
As part of the ALDREN project, a new way to check indoor spaces was suggested. It is called the TAIL rating scheme, which stands for Thermal, Acoustic, Indoor Air Quality, and Luminous. These are the four parts of an indoor environment that it checks. The TAIL rating scheme is meant to work with other indoor environmental standards and health based guidelines for exposures, particualrly, to air pollutants. 

The TAIL index checks each part and uses four colors - Green, Yellow, Orange, and Red - to show how good or bad each part is. The overall quality of the indoor space is then decided based on the worst part. A Roman numeral shows the overall quality level. The lower the score, the better the indoor space.

## What TAIL measures
The TAIL system uses twelve things to check the quality of indoor spaces:

* Thermal: The temperature of the air inside
* Acoustic: How noisy it is
* Indoor Air Quality: How fast fresh air comes in, the amount of carbon dioxide, formaldehyde, and PM2.5 (tiny dust particles), the humidity, and if there’s any visible mold (checked by looking)
* Light: How bright it is and how much daylight there is (daylight fraction checked by simulating the building’s performance)

The TAIL system is meant to be flexible. As we use it more and adapt it to different types of buildings and places, we can add other things that are relevant to each part of the indoor space. For example, in classrooms where it’s important for teachers and students to communicate, we could add a measure for echo time to the sound check. And in places where Radon is a problem, we could add a check for Radon to the air quality check.
This repository hosts the code for evaluating TAIL rating scheme of an indoor space from measured data. The current code is in R. We plan to supplement these with Python scripts subsequently.
